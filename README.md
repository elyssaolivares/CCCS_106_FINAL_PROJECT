# FIXIT - Faculty Issue eXcahange and Information Tracker

### Project Overview 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these challenges, the FIXIT (Faculty Issue eXchange and Information Tracker) introduces a mobile, web, and desktop-based maintenance reporting system that mitigates issue submissions, tracking, and administrative processing. This system enables students, faculty, and staff to conveniently report facility concerns with the use of a standardized digital platform supported by AI-powered categorization feature using NLP-trained Multimonial Naive Bayes Classification model. These allow administrators to efficiently review, edit, and assign issue statuses via a centralized dashboard that is reinforced with analytics, audit logs, and role-based authentication. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to guarantee the system's continuous usability, the system also facilitates the creation of offline reports with automatic synchronization once the users' devices' internet connection restores. FIXIT improves response time, increases transparency, lowers errors, and offers campus stakeholders a dependable tool for upholding a safer and more efficient campus environment by substituting the demanding manual process with a secure and digital-based platform.





### Problem Statement
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current campus maintenance reporting process involves actual face-to-face reports and sometimes rely on more paper-based forms submitted to the services departments. This manual workflow is so slow, lacks transparency, and prone to human errors. The kind of issues such as illegible handwriting, delayed processing, misplaced forms, and inconsistent documentation between users and maintenance staff. Faculty, students and personnel noticeably do not have reliable ways of tracking their submitted requests status, as administrators also struggle in managing reports efficiently due to absence of a centralized system. As the number of maintenance concerns and reports arise, the institution must require a more efficient, intelligent, and accessible solution for improving the campus service quality and timely repairs.
